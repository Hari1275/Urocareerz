# Task ID: 9
# Title: Admin Analytics & Audit Logs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Enhance the admin dashboard with simple analytics and audit logging.
# Details:
Add a section to the admin dashboard to display simple metrics like total user sign-ups and total number of posts. Implement a logging system to record key admin and user actions (e.g., user approved, post deleted, role changed).

# Test Strategy:
As an Admin, view the analytics dashboard and confirm the counts are correct. Perform an action like approving a user, then check the audit log to ensure the action was recorded with the correct details.
