  - Advanced search filters by specialization, date, etc.

## 8. Logical Dependency Chain
- Foundation: Authentication, user roles, and profile management
- Next: Opportunity/job board and admin moderation
- Then: Search/filters, notifications, analytics, audit logs
- MVP prioritizes visible, usable flows (register, profile, browse/apply, post jobs)
- Features are scoped to be atomic and extensible for future iterations

## 9. Risks and Mitigations
- **Technical challenges**: Custom OTP logic, secure file uploads, GDPR compliance
  - Mitigation: Use proven libraries/services (Brevo, AWS S3, Prisma)
- **MVP scoping**: Avoid feature creep (no phone/social login, no real-time chat for MVP)
- **Resource constraints**: Focus on core flows, defer advanced features

## 10. Open Questions / Future Considerations
- Support for social logins in future (Google, LinkedIn)
- Calendar-based availability (for mentors) in next iteration
- Real-time messaging or chat (if needed for later phase)
- Organization profiles and tracking
- In-app messaging & notifications
- Advanced search filters by specialization, date, etc.
