# Story 1.1: User Authentication Setup

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user (mentee, mentor, or admin),
**I want** to register and authenticate using email OTP,
**so that** I can securely access the platform and maintain my account

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can register with email address
2. System generates and sends OTP to user's email
3. User can verify OTP to complete registration
4. User can login with email and OTP verification
5. System maintains secure session with JWT tokens
6. User can logout and session is properly terminated
7. OTP expires after 10 minutes
8. Rate limiting prevents abuse (max 3 attempts per hour)
9. All authentication data is encrypted at rest
10. System logs authentication events for audit purposes

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Set up authentication database schema (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9)
  - [ ] Create User model with OTP fields

  - [ ] Create cryptographically secure OTP generator
  - [ ] Integrate Brevo email service
  - [ ] Implement OTP expiration logic
  - [ ] Add rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Task 3: Create authentication API endpoints (AC: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  - [ ] POST /api/register endpoint
  - [ ] POST /api/verify-otp endpoint
  - [ ] POST /api/login endpoint
  - [ ] POST /api/logout endpoint
  - [ ] Implement JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Task 4: Build authentication UI components (AC: 1, 3, 4, 6)
  - [ ] Create registration form component
  - [ ] Create OTP verification component
  - [ ] Create login form component
  - [ ] Implement form validation with Zod
- [ ] Task 5: Implement session management (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Set up HTTP-only cookie storage for JWT
  - [ ] Implement automatic token refresh
  - [ ] Add session timeout handling
  - [ ] Create middleware for protected routes
- [ ] Task 6: Add security measures and testing (AC: 8, 9, 10)
  - [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
  - [ ] Add security headers configuration
  - [ ] Create unit tests for authentication logic
  - [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
  - [ ] Implement audit logging for authentication events

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story, so no previous insights available.

### Data Models
Based on the architecture document, the User model should include:
- `id: ObjectId` (Primary Key)
- `email: String` (Unique)
- `firstName, lastName: String`
- `role: Role` (MENTEE | MENTOR | ADMIN)
- `otpSecret: String` (encrypted)
- `otpExpiry: DateTime`
- `termsAccepted: Boolean`
- `deletedAt: DateTime` (Soft delete)
- `createdAt, updatedAt: DateTime`

[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#3.1 Schema Design]

### API Specifications
Authentication endpoints to implement:
- `POST /api/register` - Create user and send OTP
- `POST /api/verify-otp` - Verify OTP and return JWT
- `POST /api/login` - Login with email, send OTP
- `POST /api/logout` - Invalidate session

JWT token structure: User ID, role, expiration (24-hour tokens with refresh capability)
[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#4.2 Security Implementation]

### Component Specifications
Authentication UI components needed:
- Registration form with email input
- OTP verification form
- Login form
- Form validation using React Hook Form + Zod
- Error handling and user feedback

[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#6.2 State Management Strategy]

### File Locations
Based on the existing project structure:
- API routes: `src/app/api/auth/`
- UI components: `src/components/auth/`
- Database models: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Validation schemas: `src/lib/validations.ts`
- Authentication utilities: `src/lib/auth.ts`

[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#6.1 Component Structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for OTP generation and validation
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for UI forms
- Security tests for rate limiting and encryption
- Test file location: `__tests__/` or `src/__tests__/`

[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#10.1 Performance Optimizations]

### Technical Constraints
- Use Next.js 15.4.1 with React 19.1.0
- MongoDB with Prisma ORM
- Brevo email service integration
- JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies
- Rate limiting: 3 attempts per email per hour
- OTP expiration: 10 minutes
- Data encryption at rest

[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#2.2 Technology Stack]

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test file location: `__tests__/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
- Testing frameworks: Jest with React Testing Library
- Specific testing requirements: Authentication flow testing, security testing, rate limiting validation
