# Story 1.5: Notification System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user (mentee, mentor, or admin),
**I want** to receive timely notifications about relevant events and updates,
**so that** I can stay informed about opportunities, applications, and platform activities

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users receive email notifications for important events
2. Users can view notification history in their dashboard
3. Users can mark notifications as read/unread
4. Users can delete notifications they no longer need
5. Users can configure notification preferences
6. Mentees receive notifications for opportunity applications and status changes
7. Mentors receive notifications for new applications to their opportunities
8. Admins receive notifications for new user registrations and opportunity submissions
9. System sends welcome emails to new users
10. System sends reminder emails for incomplete profiles
11. Users receive notifications for platform announcements
12. Notification system handles email delivery failures gracefully
13. Users can unsubscribe from specific notification types
14. System provides notification analytics for admins

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 (User Authentication Setup):
- User authentication provides secure session management
- Email verification system is already in place
- User data structure includes email for notifications

From Story 1.2 (User Profile Creation):
- User profiles contain role-specific information
- Profile completion status can trigger reminders

From Story 1.3 (Opportunity/Job Board):
- Opportunity applications create notification events
- Application status changes need notification triggers

From Story 1.4 (Admin Dashboard & Moderation):
- Admin actions can trigger notifications
- System announcements are managed by admins

### Data Models
Based on the architecture document, the notification system should extend existing models:

**Notification Model (new):**
- `id: ObjectId` (Primary Key)
- `userId: ObjectId` (Recipient user)
- `type: String` (APPLICATION, STATUS_CHANGE, WELCOME, REMINDER, ANNOUNCEMENT)
- `title: String` (Notification title)
- `message: String` (Notification content)
- `metadata: Json` (Additional context)
- `isRead: Boolean` (Default: false)
- `isEmailSent: Boolean` (Default: false)
- `emailSentAt: DateTime?`
- `createdAt: DateTime`
- Indexes on userId, type, isRead, createdAt

**NotificationPreference Model (new):**
- `id: ObjectId` (Primary Key)
- `userId: ObjectId` (User)
- `type: String` (Notification type)
- `emailEnabled: Boolean` (Default: true)
- `inAppEnabled: Boolean` (Default: true)
- `createdAt: DateTime`
- `updatedAt: DateTime`
- Indexes on userId, type

**User Model (extend existing):**
- Add notification preferences relationship
- Leverage existing email field for delivery

### API Specifications
Notification management endpoints to implement:
- `GET /api/notifications` - List user notifications with pagination
- `PUT /api/notifications/[id]/read` - Mark notification as read
- `PUT /api/notifications/[id]/unread` - Mark notification as unread
- `DELETE /api/notifications/[id]` - Delete notification
- `GET /api/notifications/preferences` - Get user notification preferences
- `PUT /api/notifications/preferences` - Update notification preferences
- `POST /api/notifications/unsubscribe` - Unsubscribe from notifications
- `POST /api/admin/notifications/announcement` - Send system announcement
- `GET /api/admin/notifications/analytics` - Get notification analytics

[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#5.1 Route Structure]

### Component Specifications
Notification UI components needed:
- Notification center dropdown with badge
- Notification list with read/unread states
- Notification preferences settings panel
- Email template preview component
- Notification analytics dashboard
- System announcement form
- Unsubscribe confirmation modal
- Notification filters and search interface

[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#6.2 State Management Strategy]

### File Locations
Based on the existing project structure:
- API routes: `src/app/api/notifications/`
- UI components: `src/components/notifications/`
- Database models: `prisma/schema.prisma` (add new models)
- Notification service: `src/lib/notifications.ts`
- Email templates: `src/lib/email-templates/`
- Email service: `src/lib/email.ts`

[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#6.1 Component Structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for notification service logic
- Integration tests for notification API endpoints
- Component tests for notification UI components
- Email delivery testing with mock service
- Notification preference testing
- E2E tests for notification workflows
- Performance tests for notification processing
- Test file location: `__tests__/` or `src/__tests__/`

[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#10.1 Performance Optimizations]

### Technical Constraints
- Use Next.js 15.4.1 with React 19.1.0
- MongoDB with Prisma ORM (extend existing schema)
- Email service integration (Resend recommended)
- Notification queue for reliable delivery
- Real-time notification updates
- Email template system with variables
- Notification analytics and reporting
- Unsubscribe and preference management

[Source: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENT.md#2.2 Technology Stack]

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test file location: `__tests__/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
- Testing frameworks: Jest with React Testing Library
- Specific testing requirements: Email delivery testing, notification preference validation, analytics accuracy testing
