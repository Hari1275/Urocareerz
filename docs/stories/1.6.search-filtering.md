# Story 1.6: Search & Filtering System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user (mentee, mentor, or admin),
**I want** to search and filter opportunities, users, and content effectively,
**so that** I can quickly find relevant information and opportunities that match my criteria

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can search opportunities by title, description, and location
2. Users can filter opportunities by type (job, fellowship, observership)
3. Users can filter opportunities by location (city, state, country)
4. Users can filter opportunities by experience level (entry, mid, senior)
5. Users can filter opportunities by specialty and sub-specialty
6. Users can search and filter users by name, specialty, and location
7. Search results are ranked by relevance and recency
8. Search supports partial matches and typo tolerance
9. Users can save and reuse search filters
10. Search results include pagination for large result sets
11. Users can sort results by date, relevance, or popularity
12. Search provides autocomplete suggestions
13. Advanced search allows combining multiple filters
14. Search analytics are tracked for admin insights
15. Search performance is optimized for sub-second response times

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 (User Authentication Setup):
- User authentication provides secure session management
- User data structure includes role information for filtering

From Story 1.2 (User Profile Creation):
- User profiles contain specialty, location, and role-specific data
- Profile data is essential for search and filtering

From Story 1.3 (Opportunity/Job Board):
- Opportunity model contains searchable fields (title, description, location)
- Opportunity data structure supports filtering by type and requirements

From Story 1.4 (Admin Dashboard & Moderation):
- Admin actions can affect search results (approval/rejection)
- Admin analytics can include search performance metrics

From Story 1.5 (Notification System):
- Search results can trigger notifications for saved searches
- Search analytics can inform notification strategies

### Data Models
Based on the architecture document, the search system should leverage existing models:

**SearchIndex Model (new):**
- `id: ObjectId` (Primary Key)
- `entityType: String` (OPPORTUNITY, USER)
- `entityId: ObjectId` (ID of indexed entity)
- `searchText: String` (Indexed searchable text)
- `metadata: Json` (Search metadata and filters)
- `lastIndexed: DateTime`
- `createdAt: DateTime`
- Indexes on entityType, entityId, searchText

**SavedSearch Model (new):**
- `id: ObjectId` (Primary Key)
- `userId: ObjectId` (User who saved the search)
- `name: String` (Search name)
- `query: String` (Search query)
- `filters: Json` (Applied filters)
- `entityType: String` (OPPORTUNITY, USER)
- `createdAt: DateTime`
- `updatedAt: DateTime`
- Indexes on userId, entityType

**SearchAnalytics Model (new):**
- `id: ObjectId` (Primary Key)
- `query: String` (Search query)
- `filters: Json` (Applied filters)
- `resultCount: Int` (Number of results)
- `clickedResults: Array` (Clicked result IDs)
- `searchTime: Int` (Search response time in ms)
- `userId: ObjectId?` (Anonymous if not logged in)
- `createdAt: DateTime`
- Indexes on query, createdAt, userId

**Opportunity Model (extend existing):**
- Add search index relationship
- Leverage existing fields for search (title, description, location, specialty)

**User Model (extend existing):**
- Add search index relationship
- Leverage existing fields for search (name, specialty, location)
